# LeggeroMVC
The idea is create a MVC architecture, modular and very fast to implement, but also great to do projects.
And if you think that there are too many MVC frameworks in PHP, the answer is :"Yes, there  are a lot!!!"

But, this is different, why? Easy, first at all, is only a MVC architecture and nothing else.
So, the security, views, connection with the database are up to you.
And Why this?
Because I like the idea to create everything in modules.

## How to start
Clone or Download the project, and you'll see the next folder structure:
- leggero_mvc
- demos

So, easy, the leggero_mvc, will be always outside of the projects, demos.
Inside of 'demos', you'll find examples with a different case of uses.

## Soon...
LeggeroMVC is great, but what is next?
Ok, I didn't finish LeggeroMVC yet, but also I started the same LeggeroMVC in NodeJs.
So LeggeroMVC will start to be a cross-language MVC framework, and that is the main idea.

:D
